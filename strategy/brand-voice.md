# Kilo Voice Profile

## Voice Summary

Kilo sounds like the friend who already runs a successful gym and just figured out the software side too. Confident without being cocky — every claim has a number behind it. Direct, warm, and allergic to complexity. You're reading it and thinking, "These people actually get what it's like to run a gym." Not a tech company talking down. A partner talking straight.

## Core Personality Traits

- **Results-grounded confidence:** Makes bold claims — then backs every one with a specific stat. Not "we'll help you grow" but "77% say it pays for itself in 3 months." The confidence comes from data, not bravado.
- **Anti-complexity crusader:** Positions against overwhelm, bloated interfaces, and juggling disconnected tools. "Simple" isn't a feature — it's the philosophy. If something sounds complicated, Kilo rewrites it until it doesn't.
- **Done-for-you partner:** Not a software vendor handing you a login. A team that builds your website, sets up your automation, handles your support. "Focus on your members — we'll handle the rest."
- **Gym-owner empathy:** Starts from the pain. "Running a gym is hard." "Leads slip through the cracks." "Booking sales calls is a mess." Acknowledges the struggle before offering the fix.
- **Community-backed authority:** Doesn't just claim to be good — shows you the 1,000+ gyms, the named testimonials, the partner logos, the Capterra awards. Authority earned through the gym community, not self-proclaimed.

## Tone Spectrum

| Dimension | Position | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Formal ↔ Casual | Professional-casual | Approachable but not sloppy. Uses contractions ("we'll," "you're"), but no slang or internet-speak. Reads like a smart email from a business partner, not a text from a friend. |
| Serious ↔ Playful | Mostly serious, occasional lightness | "The Rock would be proud" (testimonial they chose to feature). Not jokey, but not stiff. Lets customer humor shine in testimonials. |
| Reserved ↔ Bold | Bold with receipts | "The best investment you'll make this year." "The last marketing system you'll ever need." Strong claims, always paired with supporting proof. |
| Simple ↔ Sophisticated | Simple words, sophisticated strategy | "No hidden fees. No complexity." Uses everyday language to describe powerful systems. Never sounds like a whitepaper. |
| Warm ↔ Direct | Both — warm-direct | Empathetic opening ("Running a gym is hard"), followed by a clear solution. Doesn't waste words comforting — shows you the fix. |

## Vocabulary

**Words/phrases to USE:**
- "Built for coaching gyms" — specificity is the brand
- "Grow your gym" / "grow your membership" — the promise, repeated everywhere
- "Reclaim your time" — time savings framing
- "Done-for-you" — key differentiator (websites, newsletters, blog posts)
- "All-in-one" — but earned: "Long before 'all-in-one' became a buzzword"
- "No hidden fees" — transparency signal
- "Works out of the box" — anti-complexity
- "Live in [X] days" — speed framing (7 days GLM, 9 days websites)
- "Focus on your members" — permission to delegate
- "White-glove" — premium service framing
- Specific stats: percentages, dollar figures, member counts, time saved
- Named gym owners and gym names in testimonials — always real, never anonymous

**Words/phrases to AVOID:**
- "Leverage" / "synergy" / "optimize" / "robust" — corporate SaaS-speak
- "Revolutionary" / "disruptive" / "cutting-edge" — overhyped tech language (note: one instance of "cutting-edge" on homepage feels out of voice)
- "Guaranteed results" — compliance risk, and not Kilo's style
- "Comprehensive solution" — too vague, too corporate
- "Just" (minimizing) — don't minimize the gym owner's problems
- "Game-changing" as a descriptor from the brand — let customers say it (they do)
- "Passionate" / "excited" — empty sentiment
- Unnamed testimonials — Kilo always uses first name + gym name
- Generic fitness language that doesn't specify coaching gyms

**Jargon level:** Light-to-moderate. Uses gym industry terms naturally (NSI, lead nurture, CRM, SEO) but always explains the outcome, not just the feature. "GLM texts and emails every lead the second they opt in" — describes the action, not the technical capability.

**Profanity:** Never from the brand. Allows enthusiasm in testimonials ("I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER" in caps).

## Rhythm & Structure

**Sentences:** Short to medium. 8-18 words typical. Uses fragments for emphasis: "No hidden fees." "No complexity." Rarely goes over 25 words. When it does, it's a stat-loaded proof sentence.

**Paragraphs:** 1-3 sentences max. Lots of breathing room. One idea per paragraph. Never walls of text.

**Openings:** Lead with the outcome or the pain point, never the feature.
- Outcome: "Gym owners using a Kilo website report getting 18% more leads each month."
- Pain: "Leads slip through the cracks."
- Identity: "Software Built to Grow Coaching Gyms."

**Formatting:**
- Bold for emphasis on key stats and claims
- Tables for comparison (pain/solution, us/competitor)
- Bulleted lists for features, kept tight
- Headers use sentence case or title case, short and scannable
- CTAs repeated multiple times per page — not pushy, just always available
- Stats displayed as large numbers with supporting context

**Closing pattern:** End with a clear, simple CTA. "Watch a demo" or "Book a free call." Often paired with a reassurance: "all for just $375/month" or "No hidden fees."

## POV & Address

**First person:** "We" / "Our" (company as team, never "I")
**Reader address:** "You" / "Your gym" / "Your members" — direct, personal
**Audience label:** "Gym owners" — the term used consistently
**Relationship stance:** Expert partner. Not a guru teaching from above. Not a peer who's still figuring it out. A team that's done this 1,000+ times and will do it for you too. Think: experienced contractor, not professor.

## Example Phrases

**On-brand (sounds like Kilo):**
- "Running a gym is hard. Kilo makes it easier."
- "77% of Kilo customers say the software pays for itself in the first 3 months."
- "We'll have your system live in as little as 7 business days."
- "No hidden fees. No complexity."
- "See why hundreds of gym owners are switching from [Competitor] to Kilo."
- "The gym growth tool your competitors wish they had."
- "Focus on your members — we'll handle the rest."
- "Close 2 extra members per year, and GLM is fully paid for — everything after is yours to keep."
- "Built to move fast and stay usable."

**Off-brand (doesn't sound like Kilo):**
- "Our comprehensive, enterprise-grade platform leverages cutting-edge technology to optimize your gym operations." — Too corporate, too vague, zero personality.
- "We're passionate about empowering fitness entrepreneurs!" — Empty sentiment, not results-grounded.
- "Results may vary. Individual experiences differ." — Kilo uses specific stats and named testimonials, not weasel disclaimers.
- "Sign up for our revolutionary all-in-one AI-powered gym solution!" — Overhyped, buzzword-stuffed, not Kilo's earned confidence.
- "Hey gym fam! 💪🔥 Ready to CRUSH your goals?!" — Too casual, too hype-y, wrong audience register.

## Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Back every claim with a specific number or named testimonial
- Start from the gym owner's pain point, then present the solution
- Name real gyms and real people — specificity builds trust
- Position against complexity, not against competitors by name (except on dedicated comparison pages)
- Show ROI math — Kilo does this exceptionally well (the 2-member payback table)
- Use "coaching gyms" to signal niche expertise — this isn't generic fitness software
- Let customer testimonials carry the strongest emotional language
- Keep CTAs simple and always available: "Book a Demo" / "Book a Free Call"

**DON'T:**
- Make claims without supporting data or named proof
- Use generic SaaS marketing language ("robust," "leverage," "synergy")
- Write paragraphs longer than 3 sentences
- Sound like you're selling — sound like you're showing
- Oversell with superlatives the brand hasn't earned context for
- Forget to mention the done-for-you angle — it's Kilo's biggest differentiator
- Use anonymous testimonials or stock-photo-style social proof
- Talk about features without connecting to the outcome for the gym owner

## Voice in Ad Context

When adapting this voice for Meta Ads:

**Primary text:** Lead with a stat or pain point. Keep it to 2-3 short paragraphs. End with a clear CTA. Don't try to explain everything — drive to the next step.

**Headlines:** Bold, specific, outcome-focused. "18% More Leads. Live in 9 Days." not "Check Out Our Amazing Gym Software."

**Tone adjustment:** Slightly warmer and more direct than website copy. Ads interrupt — earn the scroll-stop with a real number or a recognized pain point, then earn the click with a clear promise.

**Social proof in ads:** Use named quotes. "Net gain of 33 members — Charlie Goode, CrossFit Watford" hits harder than "Our customers love us!"
