## 1. Voice Characteristics

Kilo's voice is defined by five adjective pairs that consistently appear across all pages:

| # | Pair | What It Means in Practice |
|---|------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **Confident but grounded** | Makes bold claims ("the best investment you'll make this year") but always backs them with specific stats, named testimonials, or third-party awards. Never bluffs. |
| 2 | **Professional but approachable** | Uses contractions ("we'll," "you're," "don't"), casual sentence structures, and gym-industry vernacular — but never slang, emoji, or hype language. Reads like a smart business partner, not a marketer. |
| 3 | **Direct but empathetic** | Leads with the gym owner's pain ("leads slip through the cracks," "booking sales calls is a mess") before presenting the fix. Acknowledges reality before selling the solution. |
| 4 | **Simple but authoritative** | Uses plain language to describe sophisticated systems. "GLM texts and emails every lead the second they opt in" — not "our AI-powered multi-channel engagement engine." Authority comes from specificity, not jargon. |
| 5 | **Ambitious but anti-hype** | Wants gym owners to grow ("210% more memberships," "grow your gym") but rejects the Silicon Valley vocabulary of "revolutionary," "disruptive," or "game-changing." Earns confidence through proof, not superlatives. |

**Voice summary:** Kilo sounds like the friend who already runs a successful gym and just figured out the software side too. Confident without being cocky — every claim has a number behind it. Direct, warm, and allergic to complexity. Not a tech company talking down. A partner talking straight.

---

## 2. Tone Spectrum

| Dimension | Position (1-10) | Evidence |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Formal <-> Casual** | 4 (professional-casual) | Contractions throughout. "Say goodbye to manual invoicing and say hello to automated payments." But no slang, no exclamation marks from the brand voice. |
| **Reserved <-> Bold** | 7 (bold with receipts) | "The best software for gym management." "The last marketing system you'll ever need." Always paired with a stat or named testimonial. |
| **Serious <-> Playful** | 3 (mostly serious) | Occasional lightness allowed in testimonials ("The Rock would be proud"). Brand voice itself stays focused and results-oriented. |
| **Technical <-> Accessible** | 3 (accessible first) | Uses some industry terms (NSI, CRM, SEO, lead nurture) but always explains the outcome. "Built-in CRM tracks every prospect, so you can close more sales without wasting time on manual follow-ups." Feature + outcome, every time. |
| **Warm <-> Clinical** | 4 (warm-direct) | "Running a gym is hard." "We're obsessed with making life easier for gym owners." Empathy is structural — it opens sections — but Kilo doesn't linger. Pain point, then solution. |
| **Urgent <-> Patient** | 5 (moderate urgency) | "Speed matters." "Live in 7 business days." Time-sensitive framing without countdown timers or scarcity tactics. The urgency is about the gym owner's time, not artificial pressure. |

## 3. Language Patterns

### Recurring Words and Phrases

These words appear across 3+ pages consistently:

| Word/Phrase | Frequency | Context |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| "Grow your gym" / "grow your membership" | Every page | The core promise — appears in hero copy, CTAs, and section headers |
| "Built for coaching gyms" | Homepage, GLM, GMS, About | The identity statement — signals niche specificity |
| "Reclaim your time" | Homepage, GLM | Time-savings framing — positions Kilo as a time multiplier |
| "Done-for-you" | Websites, GLM, About | Key differentiator from DIY software competitors |
| "All-in-one" | GLM, GMS, Homepage | Consolidation value prop — but used carefully, with earned credibility: "Long before 'all-in-one' became a buzzword" |
| "No hidden fees" | GLM, Pricing | Transparency signal — short, declarative |
| "Works out of the box" | GLM | Anti-complexity positioning |
| "Focus on your members" | Homepage, GLM, GMS | Permission to delegate — the emotional payoff |
| "Live in [X] days" | Websites (9 days), GLM (7 days) | Speed-to-value framing |
| "White-glove" | Websites, Support | Premium service descriptor |
| "Streamline" / "simplify" | GMS, GLM, Homepage | The anti-complexity vocabulary |
| "Gym owners" | Every page | Audience label — always this, never "fitness entrepreneurs" or "studio owners" |

### Sentence Structure Patterns

1. **Pain -> Solution (most common):**
   - "Leads slip through the cracks." -> "Built-in CRM + automated follow-ups."
   - "Booking sales calls is a mess." -> "Hands-free appointment booking."
   - "Wasted time on DIY tools." -> "Works out of the box in 7 days."

2. **Stat-led proof:**
   - "77% of Kilo customers say the software pays for itself in the first 3 months."
   - "Gym owners using a Kilo website report getting 18% more leads each month."
   - "80% of Kilo customers report that Kilo is easier to use than their previous software."

3. **Short declarative fragments for emphasis:**
   - "No hidden fees. No complexity."
   - "Speed matters."
   - "Simple. Intuitive. Built for coaching gyms."

4. **Feature + outcome (always paired):**
   - "Easily manage classes, appointments, and staff availability with intuitive scheduling tools." (feature + "intuitive" outcome)
   - "Real-time data on revenue, attendance, and retention to make smarter decisions." (feature + "smarter decisions" outcome)

5. **ROI math (unique to Kilo):**
   - "Close 2 extra members per year, and GLM is fully paid for — everything after is yours to keep."
   - 2 members/year = $7,200 revenue = 60% ROI; 12 members/year = $43,200 = 860% ROI

### Paragraph Length

- 1-3 sentences maximum per paragraph across all 5 pages
- Heavy use of white space and visual breathing room
- One idea per paragraph, never stacked
- Long-form only appears in blog content, never on product/conversion pages

### Jargon Level

Light-to-moderate. Uses gym industry terms naturally (NSI, lead nurture, CRM, SEO) but always explains the outcome, not just the feature. "GLM texts and emails every lead the second they opt in" — describes the action, not the technical capability.

### Profanity

Never from the brand. Allows enthusiasm in testimonials ("I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER" in caps).

### Rhythm and Structure

**Sentences:** Short to medium. 8-18 words typical. Uses fragments for emphasis: "No hidden fees." "No complexity." Rarely goes over 25 words. When it does, it's a stat-loaded proof sentence.

**Openings:** Lead with the outcome or the pain point, never the feature.
- Outcome: "Gym owners using a Kilo website report getting 18% more leads each month."
- Pain: "Leads slip through the cracks."
- Identity: "Software Built to Grow Coaching Gyms."

**Formatting:**
- Bold for emphasis on key stats and claims
- Tables for comparison (pain/solution, us/competitor)
- Bulleted lists for features, kept tight
- Headers use sentence case or title case, short and scannable
- CTAs repeated multiple times per page — not pushy, just always available
- Stats displayed as large numbers with supporting context

**Closing pattern:** End with a clear, simple CTA. "Watch a demo" or "Book a free call." Often paired with a reassurance: "all for just $375/month" or "No hidden fees."

## 4. Do / Don't

### DO:

| Guideline | Why | Example from Site |
|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| Back every claim with a specific number or named testimonial | Kilo never makes an unbacked assertion on any product page | "77% of Kilo customers say the software pays for itself in the first 3 months." |
| Start from the gym owner's pain point, then present the solution | This is the structural pattern on every page — empathy before pitch | "Leads slip through the cracks." -> "Built-in CRM + automated follow-ups." |
| Name real gyms and real people | Every testimonial includes first name, last name, and gym name | "Jay Storey, CrossFit Narellan" / "Bethany Ream, CrossFit Wooster" |
| Use "coaching gyms" to signal niche expertise | This phrase separates Kilo from generic fitness SaaS competitors | "Software built for coaching gyms." |
| Show ROI math | Kilo's most distinctive copy pattern — makes the value tangible | The 2-member payback table on the GLM page |
| Position against complexity, not against competitors by name | Anti-complexity is the brand's emotional through-line | "No hidden fees. No complexity." / "Works out of the box." |
| Keep CTAs simple and always available | Multiple CTAs per page, never aggressive, always the same language | "Book a Free Call" / "Watch a Demo" / "Speak with an Expert" |
| Let customer testimonials carry the strongest emotional language | The brand stays measured; customers get to be enthusiastic | "I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER" / "best decisions I've made for my gym" |
| Use "you" and "your gym" — make the reader the subject | Second-person address throughout every page | "Run your gym, grow your membership, and reclaim your time." |
| Connect every feature to an outcome for the gym owner | Features are never listed alone — always tied to what changes | "Automated payments" -> "Say goodbye to manual invoicing." |

### DON'T:

| Guideline | Why | Anti-Example |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Use corporate SaaS jargon | Kilo's identity is anti-complexity; these words betray it | "Leverage," "synergy," "robust," "comprehensive solution," "enterprise-grade" |
| Use overhyped tech language | Kilo earns confidence through proof, not buzzwords | "Revolutionary," "disruptive," "cutting-edge," "game-changing," "AI-powered" |
| Make claims without supporting data | Unbacked assertions break the trust pattern | "Guaranteed results" / "Best gym software ever" without stats |
| Write paragraphs longer than 3 sentences | Every page uses tight, scannable copy blocks | Walls of text, long run-on explanations |
| Sound like you're selling — sound like you're showing | Kilo presents evidence and lets the reader decide | "Buy now!" / "Don't miss out!" / "Limited time offer!" |
| Use anonymous testimonials | Kilo always names the person, title, and gym | "One gym owner said..." / "Our customers love us!" |
| Forget the done-for-you angle | It's Kilo's biggest differentiator vs. self-serve competitors | Writing about Kilo as if it's just another SaaS login |
| Talk about features without connecting to outcomes | Isolated feature lists feel generic and miss the value | "CRM included" without "so you can close more sales" |
| Use empty enthusiasm from the brand voice | Kilo's tone is confident and warm, not peppy | "We're passionate about empowering fitness entrepreneurs!" / "We're excited to announce!" |
| Minimize the gym owner's challenges | The voice respects how hard gym ownership is | "Just use our simple tool" — "just" minimizes the problem |

- "We're passionate about empowering fitness entrepreneurs!" — Empty sentiment, not results-grounded.
- "Results may vary. Individual experiences differ." — Kilo uses specific stats and named testimonials, not weasel disclaimers.
- "Sign up for our revolutionary all-in-one AI-powered gym solution!" — Overhyped, buzzword-stuffed, not Kilo's earned confidence.
- "Hey gym fam! Ready to CRUSH your goals?!" — Too casual, too hype-y, wrong audience register.

## 6. Audience Address

### How Kilo Refers to the Reader

| Pattern | Usage | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **"You" / "Your"** | Primary address — every paragraph uses second person | "Run your gym, grow your membership, and reclaim your time." |
| **"Your gym"** | Possessive — makes the reader the owner of the outcome | "A high-performing website designed to attract new members and grow your gym." |
| **"Your members"** | Creates ownership of the people they serve | "Focus on your members — we'll handle the rest." |
| **"Gym owners"** | The label for the audience — always this exact phrase | "Trusted by +1000 gym owners worldwide." / "We're obsessed with making life easier for gym owners." |
| **"Coaching gyms"** | The qualifier for what type of gyms Kilo serves | "Software built for coaching gyms." — Never just "gyms" or "fitness businesses." |
| **"Independent gym owners"** | Used when emphasizing the underdog positioning | "Most software companies are not built for the reality independent gym owners face." |

### How Kilo Refers to Itself

| Pattern | Usage | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **"We" / "Our"** | Team voice — never "I" or individual names in brand copy | "We'll have your system live in as little as 7 business days." |
| **"Kilo"** | Third person for product references and brand statements | "Kilo simplifies gym operations." / "80% of Kilo customers report..." |
| **"A partner"** | Relationship framing — not vendor, not provider | "A partner who understands the pressure gym owners face." |

### Relationship Stance

Kilo positions as the **experienced partner** — not a tech company selling software, not a guru teaching from a stage. The relationship is peer-level but with a clear expertise advantage. Think: the friend who already runs a successful gym and just figured out the software side too. They talk to gym owners as equals who happen to have the tools. A team that's done this 1,000+ times and will do it for you too. Think: experienced contractor, not professor.

---

## 7. Proof Pattern

Kilo uses a layered proof system that builds trust progressively. Every page deploys at least 3 of these 6 proof types:

### Proof Type 1: Specific Statistics (Quantitative)

Always specific, never vague. Percentages, dollar figures, member counts, and time saved.

| Stat | Page Used | Context |
|------|-----------|---------|
| "1,000+ gyms worldwide" | Homepage, Websites | Scale proof |
| "18% more leads monthly" | Homepage, Websites | Website product proof |
| "61% lead volume increase in 3 months" | Websites | Website product proof |
| "210% membership growth" | GLM | Marketing automation proof |
| "384 hours saved per year" | GLM | Time-savings proof |
| "35.3 more qualified leads per month" | GLM | Lead generation proof |
| "77% say it pays for itself in 3 months" | Homepage, GLM | ROI proof |
| "80% say easier to use than previous software" | Homepage, GMS | Ease-of-use proof |
| "92% would highly recommend" | Websites | Satisfaction proof |

### Proof Type 2: Named Testimonials (Qualitative)

Every testimonial includes: first name, last name, gym name, and often a specific metric.

| Person | Gym | Key Quote | Page |
|--------|-----|-----------|------|
| Mike Williams | No Limits Fitness | Featured testimonial (above-fold, homepage) | Homepage |
| Mark Fisher | Mark Fisher Fitness (MFF) | Industry authority endorsement | Homepage |

| Andrew Hiller | (Fitness influencer) | Media personality endorsement | Homepage |
| Bethany Ream | CrossFit Wooster | "More leads in one week than 2-3 months" | Websites |
| Lindsey Barber | Fitness Lair | "Drowning in website traffic I never knew I had" | Websites |
| Russell Francis | JCFIT | Google Ads company rated site "outstanding," 99-100% scores | Websites |
| Jay Storey | CrossFit Narellan | "7 NSIs and 5 new members in 5 days" | GLM |
| Lisa Palmer | Gas Station Fitness | "Improved gross revenue" | GLM |
| Courtney Strout | CrossFit Veneration | "Scheduling makes life 10x easier" | GLM |
| Charlie Goode | CrossFit Watford | "Net gain of 33 members, averaging 14/month vs 6 before" | GLM |
| George-Anthony Dulal | Brainstorm Fitness | "Best systems I've ever used in my 17 years coaching" | Customers |

### Proof Type 3: Third-Party Awards (Authority)

Displayed as a visual badge bar, usually mid-page:
- Capterra Best Value 2025
- Software Advice Front Runners 2025
- GetApp Category Leaders 2025
- Capterra Best Ease of Use 2025
- Capterra Shortlist 2025

### Proof Type 4: Industry Partner Logos (Association)

Logos from recognized gym business mentors/media:
- Two Brain Business (Chris Cooper)
- Business for Unicorns (Mark Fisher)
- All Day Fit
- Andrew Hiller
- The Sevan Podcast
- Mike Dohla
- 11 partners total in carousel

### Proof Type 5: ROI Math (Calculable)

Unique to Kilo — they show the math so the reader can verify the claim:

| Members Gained | Annual Revenue | GLM Cost | ROI |
|---------------|---------------|----------|-----|
| 2/year | $7,200 | $4,500 | 60% |
| 12/year | $43,200 | $4,500 | 860% |
| 24/year | $86,200 | $4,500 | 1,820% |

"Close 2 extra members per year, and GLM is fully paid for — everything after is yours to keep."

### Proof Type 6: Problem/Solution Tables (Comparative)

| Problem (Gym Owner Reality) | GLM Fix (Kilo Solution) |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Leads slip through the cracks | Built-in CRM + automated follow-ups |
| Wasted time on DIY tools | Works out of the box in 7 days |
| Marketing agencies are expensive | 80% agency value at a fraction of the cost |
| Booking sales calls is a mess | Hands-free appointment booking |

Also uses comparison tables (Build It Yourself vs Local Provider vs Kilo) on the Websites page.

## 8. CTA Style

### Primary CTAs (High-Intent)

| CTA Text | Placement | Destination |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| "Book a Demo" | Navigation bar (every page) | /book-your-sales-call/ |
| "Book a Free Call" | Mid-page and bottom sections | /book-your-sales-call/ |
| "Speak with an Expert" | Homepage hero | /book-your-sales-call/ |
| "Book a call with a Kilo expert" | GLM page | /book-your-sales-call/ |
| "Get Started Today" | Pricing page | /book-your-sales-call/ |

### Secondary CTAs (Lower-Intent)

| CTA Text | Placement | Destination |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| "Watch a Demo" / "Watch The Demo" | Homepage hero, multiple pages | Video popup |
| "See How It Works" | Websites page | Video popup |
| "Learn More" | Product cards on homepage | Product pages |
| "See More Gym Success Stories" | Homepage | /customers/ |
| "Take The First Step" | Websites page bottom | /book-your-sales-call/ |
| "Learn More About the Kilo Advantage" | Websites page | /book-your-sales-call/ |

### CTA Characteristics

1. **Always low-pressure:** "Book a Free Call" not "Buy Now." "See How It Works" not "Sign Up Today." The entire funnel drives to a conversation, never a checkout page.

2. **Repeated but not aggressive:** CTAs appear 4-6 times per page but with varied wording. They're always available without feeling pushy.

3. **Often paired with reassurance:** "All for just $375/month." "No hidden fees." "Most gyms see results within the first couple of weeks." The CTA is cushioned by a risk-reducer.

4. **Action-oriented verbs:** Book, Watch, See, Learn, Get Started, Take. Never passive ("Submit," "Enter," "Continue"). The gym owner is taking a positive action, not completing a form.

5. **Expert framing:** "Speak with an Expert" and "Book a call with a Kilo expert" — positions the sales team as consultants, not salespeople.

6. **Persistent nav CTA:** "Book a Demo" is always visible in the navigation bar on every page — the default next step is always one click away.

---

## Voice in Ad Context

When adapting this voice for Meta Ads:

**Primary text:** Lead with a stat or pain point. Keep it to 2-3 short paragraphs. End with a clear CTA. Don't try to explain everything — drive to the next step.

**Headlines:** Bold, specific, outcome-focused. "18% More Leads. Live in 9 Days." not "Check Out Our Amazing Gym Software."

**Tone adjustment:** Slightly warmer and more direct than website copy. Ads interrupt — earn the scroll-stop with a real number or a recognized pain point, then earn the click with a clear promise.

**Social proof in ads:** Use named quotes. "Net gain of 33 members — Charlie Goode, CrossFit Watford" hits harder than "Our customers love us!"

**Avoid in ads:** Feature dumps, generic promises ("grow your business"), unnamed proof, urgency tactics (countdown timers, "limited spots"), and any language that sounds like every other SaaS ad.

---

## Voice Consistency Notes

### What's on-brand across all 5 pages:
- Second-person address ("you/your") in every section
- Stat-backed claims — never an unsubstantiated assertion
- Named testimonials with gym name and specific results
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences), heavy white space
- Pain-first then solution-second structural pattern
- "Coaching gyms" as the audience qualifier
- CTAs that lead to conversations, not checkouts

### Minor inconsistencies observed:
- One instance of "cutting-edge" on the homepage feels out of voice (corporate SaaS-speak Kilo otherwise avoids)
- The About page is thinner on copy than product pages — less distinctive voice, more generic "passionate team" language
- Some industry pages (CrossFit, Martial Arts) use slightly different headline formulas ("Easy gym software that powers hard classes") that could be A/B tested for consistency

---

*This document should be used as the primary reference for all Kilo ad copy, landing page copy, email sequences, and content creation. When in doubt, read it out loud — if it sounds like a tech company talking at gym owners, rewrite it. If it sounds like a smart partner talking with gym owners, you're on brand.*
