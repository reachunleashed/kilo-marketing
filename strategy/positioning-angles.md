# Positioning Angles — Kilo

## Pre-Work

### What Kilo Actually Sells (The Transformation)

Not software. Not features. The transformation is:

- **From:** Overwhelmed gym owner juggling 5 disconnected tools, losing leads, spending nights on admin
- **To:** Confident operator with one connected system that handles marketing, management, and your website — while you coach

The deeper transformation: *Getting your time back without sacrificing growth.*

### Alternatives (What They'd Do Without Kilo)

| Alternative | Weakness Kilo Exploits |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Do nothing (spreadsheets, manual follow-up) | Leads slip through cracks. No system = no growth. |
| DIY tools (Wix + Mailchimp + HubSpot + Calendly) | Disconnected. Expensive in aggregate. Time-consuming to manage. Not gym-specific. |
| Hire a marketing agency | $2K-5K/month. Generic strategies. No gym expertise. Can't fire them easily. |
| Direct competitor (Wodify, PushPress, Zen Planner) | No done-for-you websites. No all-in-one. Bloated or limited. |
| Mindbody / generic wellness platforms | Expensive. Enterprise feel. Not built for coaching gyms. |

### Unique Mechanism

**The "Gym Growth Engine"** — software + done-for-you services + ongoing support in one subscription.

Kilo doesn't hand you a login and say "good luck." They:
1. Build your website FOR you (live in 9 days)
2. Set up your automated lead nurture FOR you (pre-built sequences)
3. Maintain and redesign everything FOR you (annual refresh, monthly newsletters + blog posts)
4. Support you with 3 specialized teams (website, marketing, management)

No competitor offers this combination. This is the mechanism that makes the promise believable.

### Market Sophistication: Stage 3 (Crowded)

Multiple players. Similar "gym management software" claims. The market has heard "all-in-one" before. Skepticism is moderate. **The angle must explain WHY Kilo works when others don't** — the mechanism matters more than the claim.

## The 5 Angles

### Angle 1: "Done-For-You" (Unique Mechanism)

- **The angle:** Kilo doesn't give you another tool to figure out — they build your website, set up your automation, and handle the ongoing work for you. You focus on coaching. They focus on growth.
- **Why it works:** Gym owners are action people, not software people. They've been burned by tools that promise the world and deliver a login screen. "We do it for you" removes the #1 objection: "I don't have time to learn another platform." This is Kilo's moat — no competitor offers this level of service.
- **Headline directions:**
  - "Your gym website. Built for you. Live in 9 days."
  - "We build it. You coach. Your gym grows."
  - "Done-for-you marketing that actually works — $375/mo."
  - "Stop DIY-ing your gym's growth. We'll do it for you."
- **When to use:** Cold audiences who don't know Kilo. Top-of-funnel. Especially effective for gym owners who've tried (and failed with) other tools. Lead creative for Meta prospecting campaigns.
- **Pain point targeted:** "I don't have time to learn another platform"
- **Primary product focus:** GLM + Websites bundle

### Angle 2: "The Switch" (Social Proof + Enemy)

- **The angle:** Hundreds of gym owners already switched from [Wodify/Zen Planner/PushPress/Mindbody] to Kilo — and they're getting more leads, saving time, and never looking back. You're the last one still using [old tool].
- **Why it works:** Social proof reduces risk. Named gyms switching is more powerful than any feature comparison. It triggers loss aversion ("everyone else already moved") and specificity ("CrossFit Watford gained 33 members"). Kilo already has dedicated comparison pages with real gym logos — this angle is pre-validated.
- **Headline directions:**
  - "See why 100+ gym owners switched from Wodify to Kilo."
  - "Still on Zen Planner? Here's what you're missing."
  - "CrossFit Watford gained 33 members after switching. What's your excuse?"
  - "Gyms are leaving [Competitor]. Here's where they're going."
- **When to use:** Mid-funnel retargeting. Competitor-targeted audiences (interest in Wodify, PushPress, etc.). Works especially well with carousel ads showing real gym logos of switchers.
- **Pain point targeted:** "My current software is frustrating / limited / overpriced"
- **Primary product focus:** GMS (management) — the switching story starts with the core platform

### Angle 3: "The ROI Math" (Risk Reversal via Numbers)

- **The angle:** Close 2 extra members per year and GLM has already paid for itself. Everything after that is pure profit. 77% of gym owners say it pays for itself in 3 months.
- **Why it works:** Makes the investment feel riskless by doing the math for them. Gym owners understand membership revenue. When you show "$375/mo costs less than 2 memberships per year," the objection dissolves. Kilo's ROI table (60% → 860% → 1820% ROI) is one of the strongest conversion tools on their site.
- **Headline directions:**
  - "2 extra members. That's all it takes for Kilo to pay for itself."
  - "$375/mo. 77% of gym owners say it pays for itself in 3 months."
  - "What if your gym software made you more money than it cost?"
  - "860% ROI. That's not a typo."
- **When to use:** Bottom-of-funnel. Retargeting site visitors who saw pricing but didn't book. Effective for gym owners who acknowledge they need help but are price-sensitive.
- **Pain point targeted:** "Can I afford this?" / "Is it worth the money?"
- **Primary product focus:** GLM ($375/mo) — the ROI story is strongest here

### Angle 4: "Time Recapture" (Transformation)

- **The angle:** You didn't open a gym to sit behind a screen chasing leads and fighting software. Kilo gives you 384 hours back every year — that's time to coach, to be with your family, to actually enjoy running your gym.
- **Why it works:** Every gym owner opened their gym because they love coaching, not because they love admin. The emotional gap between "why I started this gym" and "what I actually spend my time doing" is enormous. 384 hours/year (7.4 hrs/week) is tangible and specific.
- **Headline directions:**
  - "384 hours. That's how much time gym owners save with Kilo every year."
  - "You didn't open a gym to chase leads. Let Kilo do it."
  - "What would you do with 7 extra hours every week?"
  - "More coaching. Less admin. That's what Kilo does."
- **When to use:** Broad prospecting. Emotional creative (video testimonials, story-driven ads). Works well for gym owners who are burned out but haven't identified software as the fix yet.
- **Pain point targeted:** "I'm spending all my time on admin instead of coaching"
- **Primary product focus:** Bundle (GMS + GLM) — time savings come from the full system

### Angle 5: "Built for Coaching Gyms" (Specificity / Identity)

- **The angle:** Kilo isn't for yoga studios, spin chains, or big-box gyms. It's built specifically for coaching gyms — CrossFit, martial arts, bootcamp, HYROX, personal training studios. If you run a coaching gym, this was built for you. If you don't, it wasn't.
- **Why it works:** In a sea of generic "gym management" tools, specificity wins. When a CrossFit affiliate owner sees "built for coaching gyms" vs "built for fitness businesses," the first one signals "these people understand my world." Exclusion creates belonging. Kilo's industry pages, gym-type-specific testimonials, and partnership with Two Brain Business all reinforce this angle.
- **Headline directions:**
  - "The only gym software built specifically for coaching gyms."
  - "CrossFit. Martial arts. Bootcamp. HYROX. If you coach, Kilo was built for you."
  - "Not another generic gym tool. Kilo is built for how coaching gyms actually run."
  - "1,000+ coaching gyms run on Kilo. Here's why."
- **When to use:** Interest-targeted campaigns (CrossFit, martial arts, HYROX). Works with industry-specific creative showing real coaching gym environments. Strongest when paired with gym-type-specific testimonials.
- **Pain point targeted:** "Other software doesn't understand how my gym works"
- **Primary product focus:** All products — this is a brand-level angle
