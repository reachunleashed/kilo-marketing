## Competitive Gaps / Opportunities

1. **PushPress is the closest threat** — same target market, strong brand, 8-figure revenue. Kilo's website/branding service is a clear differentiator
2. **Wodify/Zen Planner are legacy platforms** — Kilo can aggressively position as the modern alternative
3. **No competitor offers done-for-you websites** — this is Kilo's unique moat
4. **GLM's ROI story is compelling** — "2 extra members/year pays for itself" is a powerful ad angle
5. **Review site awards** provide third-party credibility that competitors lack at this scale
