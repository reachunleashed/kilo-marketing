### ROI Math — Variant B
**Angle:** ROI Math
**Audience segment:** Gym owners who've been burned by marketing spend with no results
**Placement:** Feed

**Primary Text:**
You've probably spent money on marketing that didn't work. Boosted posts. A freelancer who ghosted. An agency that sent "brand awareness" reports while your membership stayed flat.

Here's what's different about Kilo:

On average, gym owners using Gym Lead Machine report 35.3 more qualified leads per month. That's not impressions. That's people who filled out a form and got an automatic follow-up text within minutes.

**Angle:** Time Recapture
**Audience segment:** Burnt-out gym owners doing everything themselves
**Placement:** Feed

**Primary Text:**
384 hours.

That's how much time gym owners report saving per year with Kilo. Roughly 8 hours a week you're currently spending on admin, lead chasing, manual follow-ups, and fighting your software.

8 hours a week back. That's a full coaching day. Or a day off. Or both, split across the week.

You didn't open a gym to spend your evenings copying leads into spreadsheets. You opened it to coach.

"I've had 7 NSIs and 5 new members in 5 days." — Jay Storey, CrossFit Narellan

## ANGLE 5: "Built for Coaching Gyms" (Identity / Specificity)
**Product focus:** All products | **Pain:** "Other software doesn't understand my gym"

---

### Built for Coaching Gyms — Variant A
**Angle:** Built for Coaching Gyms
**Audience segment:** CrossFit / functional fitness gym owners
**Placement:** Feed

**Primary Text:**
Most gym software was built for big-box fitness chains and adapted for everyone else. That's why half the features don't apply to your gym — and the ones that matter are clunky.

Kilo was built from day one for coaching gyms. CrossFit boxes. Martial arts schools. Bootcamps. HYROX training. PT studios.

Every feature exists because a coaching gym owner asked for it. Nothing exists because an enterprise sales team demanded it.

1,000+ coaching gyms run on Kilo. Capterra Best Value and Best Ease of Use, 2025.

"Kilo doesn't have unnecessary features. It's built to match what gyms need." — Chris Cooper, Two-Brain Business

### Built for Coaching Gyms — Variant B
**Angle:** Built for Coaching Gyms
**Audience segment:** Martial arts / bootcamp / HYROX / niche gym owners
**Placement:** Feed / Reels

**Primary Text:**
You run a coaching gym. Not a check-in-and-use-the-machines gym.

Your members know your name. You program their workouts. You notice when they miss a week. That's a fundamentally different business than a 10,000-member health club — and it needs fundamentally different software.

Kilo was built for this. Memberships, class scheduling, workout tracking, payments, staff management, and a mobile app your members will actually use. Plus done-for-you marketing if you want it.

$150/mo for management. $375/mo to add a website, CRM, and automated lead nurture.

"Since switching, we've 3x'd revenue. Everything in one place." — Amanda Alexander, Southwest Training

Book a demo. See why 1,000+ coaching gyms chose Kilo.

**Headlines:**
1. Software That Gets Coaching Gyms.
2. Your Members Know Your Name. Your Software Should Too.
3. $150/mo. Built Specifically for Your Gym.
4. 1,000+ Coaching Gyms. One Platform.

**Descriptions:**
1. CrossFit, martial arts, bootcamp, HYROX, PT studios.
2. Management from $150/mo. Add marketing for $375/mo.

### Built for Coaching Gyms — Variant C
**Angle:** Built for Coaching Gyms
**Audience segment:** Gym owners comparing multiple platforms / in research mode
**Placement:** Feed

**Primary Text:**
Here's a quick way to evaluate gym software:

Ask them how many coaching gyms they serve. Not total customers. Coaching gyms specifically.

Kilo's answer: 1,000+. That's all we do. Every product decision, every feature release, every support conversation is filtered through one question — does this help coaching gym owners?

Website that converts for a 150-member CrossFit box? Built for that. Lead automation for a martial arts school running a 6-week intro? Built for that. Reporting that makes sense when you have 3 coaches and 200 members? Built for that.

"Care and thoughtfulness behind every feature." — Jaclyn Bates, Limitless Performance

**Headlines:**
1. 1,000+ Coaching Gyms. Zero Big-Box Chains.
2. Ask Your Software: How Many Gyms Like Mine Do You Serve?
