## PROBLEM — The Real Cost of "Figuring It Out Yourself"

You opened your gym to coach people. To change lives. To build something that matters.

But here's what your week actually looks like:

**Hours disappear** into admin. Updating your website. Chasing leads who filled out a form three days ago. Googling "how to set up email automation." Jumping between four different apps that don't talk to each other.

Meanwhile, the leads you worked so hard to get? **They're going cold.** Studies show that responding to a lead within 5 minutes makes you **21x more likely** to convert them. But you were coaching the 6 AM class when that form came in.

And the cost of duct-taping it together? It adds up fast:

- Website builder: **$100-300/mo**
- Email marketing tool: **$50-100/mo**
- CRM: **$50-200/mo**
- Scheduling app: **$30-50/mo**
- Your time wiring it all together: **Priceless. And wasted.**

You're spending **$200-500/month** on tools that still don't work together — and burning hours every week doing work that has nothing to do with coaching.

## AGITATE — Sound Familiar?

It's 9 PM on a Tuesday.

You finished coaching four hours ago. But you're still at the gym — or worse, at your kitchen table — trying to figure out why your website form isn't sending notifications.

A lead came in this morning. You saw it at lunch. You meant to call. But then the 4:30 class showed up, a member needed to freeze their account, and you still haven't posted on social media this week.

By the time you text that lead back, they've already booked an intro at the gym down the street.

**This isn't a time management problem. It's a systems problem.**

And you shouldn't have to solve it yourself.

## SOLUTION — What If Someone Just... Did It For You?

Kilo isn't another tool you have to learn. It's a team that builds your growth engine and keeps it running.

Here's what changes when you switch to Kilo:

### Your Website — Built For You. Live in 9 Days.

You fill out a questionnaire. Kilo's team designs a professional, SEO-optimized website built to convert visitors into leads. You review it on a live call. It launches.

No dragging and dropping. No watching YouTube tutorials. No hiring your nephew who "knows Squarespace."

**And it stays current.** Kilo includes an annual redesign, monthly blog posts, and monthly newsletters — all written and published for you.

### Your Lead Follow-Up — Set Up For You. Runs Automatically.

A lead fills out your form at 6 AM. Before you've finished your first coffee, they've already received a personalized text and email. Automated follow-up sequences nurture them toward booking an intro — without you lifting a finger.

**Your system is live in as little as 7 business days.** Pre-built sequences. Proven templates. Configured for your gym.

### Your Marketing — Handled For You. Month After Month.

Monthly newsletters. Blog content. Google review requests. Social media templates. Kilo's team creates it. You approve it (or don't — it goes out either way, because consistency beats perfection).

### Your Support — Three Specialized Teams. One Platform.

Most software gives you a chatbot and a prayer. Kilo gives you three dedicated support teams:
- **Website team** — design changes, updates, new pages
- **Marketing team** — campaigns, lead nurture, automation
- **Software team** — billing, scheduling, member management

Average response time: **under 3 hours.** Even on weekends.

### Step 3: You Coach. Leads Come In.
Leads flow in from your website. Follow-up happens automatically. You check your dashboard when you want. You coach when you should. That's it.

## ROI MATH — The "Two Members" Test

Let's keep this simple.

Your average member pays **$180/month** and stays for **20 months**.

That's **$3,600 in lifetime revenue** per member.

Kilo's Gym Lead Machine costs **$375/month**. That's **$4,500/year**.

**Close just 2 extra members this year and Kilo has paid for itself.** Everything after that is profit.

Not 20 members. Not 10. **Two.**

And the average gym using Kilo's lead system reports **35.3 more qualified leads per month.** Even at a modest close rate, that's not two members per year. That's two members per month.

**77% of Kilo customers report the software pays for itself within the first 3 months.**

_[Visual note: Simple calculator-style graphic showing the math. $180 x 20 months = $3,600. $375 x 12 = $4,500. 2 members = $7,200. Net: +$2,700 profit in year one — before counting the other leads you'll close.]_

### Two members. That's the breakeven.

## FAQ — Questions We Hear Every Week

**How long until I see results?**
Most gyms see an increase in leads within the first couple of weeks after launching. Your website goes live in 9 days. Your lead nurture system can be running in as little as 7 business days. This isn't a "wait 6 months and hope" situation.

**Will this work for my type of gym?**
If you run a coaching-style gym, yes. Kilo is built specifically for CrossFit boxes, martial arts schools, bootcamp facilities, HYROX training centers, PT studios, and small group training gyms. We work with over **1,000 gyms** across these formats.

**What about switching costs? I don't want another painful migration.**
We handle it. Kilo's team manages your data migration and builds your new website from scratch — you don't port over an old site. White-glove onboarding is included. Most gym owners say the switch was easier than expected, and **80% report Kilo is easier to use than their previous software.**

**Is there a long-term contract?**
Gym Management Software has a 1-year commitment. Gym Lead Machine — check with the Kilo team on your call for current terms. No hidden fees on any plan.

**What if I just need a website?**
Kilo offers standalone gym websites at **$175/mo** with the same done-for-you build process. But most gym owners find that pairing the website with the lead nurture system (GLM) is where the real ROI kicks in — because getting traffic is only half the battle. Converting it is the other half.

**How is Kilo different from [competitor]?**
Most gym software handles either management OR marketing. Kilo is the only platform that combines gym management, marketing automation, AND done-for-you websites — all built specifically for coaching gyms. You're not adapting a generic tool. You're using something built by people who understand your business.

**Do I need to be tech-savvy?**
No. That's the whole point. We build it. We maintain it. We support it. You coach.

## FINAL CTA — Your Gym Deserves a Growth System. Not Another App to Manage.

You got into this business to coach. To help people get stronger, healthier, more confident.

Somewhere along the way, you became a part-time marketer, part-time web developer, and full-time admin.

**It doesn't have to be that way.**

Kilo builds your website, sets up your lead nurture, and handles the ongoing marketing — so you can get back to the work that actually matters.

**1,000+ gym owners** already made the switch. **77% say it paid for itself in 3 months.**

The only question is how many leads you're losing while you wait.
