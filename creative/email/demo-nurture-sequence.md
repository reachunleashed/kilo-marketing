## Email 1: Open the Conversation

**Send Timing:** Immediately after demo booking (or within 1 hour of lead capture)
**Purpose:** Confirm the demo, set expectations, begin the relationship with a personal touch
**Objection Addressed:** None -- this is a warm handshake, not a pitch

**Subject Line:** Quick question about {{gym_name}}
**Preview Text:** Before your demo, I wanted to ask...

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Thanks for booking a demo with Kilo. Before we talk, I have a quick question:

What's the one thing about running {{gym_name}} that takes up more of your time than it should?

Not a trick question. I ask because every gym owner I talk to has a different answer -- and it helps me make sure your demo is actually useful instead of a generic walkthrough.

Just hit reply. One sentence is plenty.

In the meantime, here's what to expect on the call:

- It's 15-20 minutes, not a marathon
- We'll look at your specific situation, not a canned slide deck
- No pressure. Kilo works for over 1,000 coaching gyms worldwide, but it's not for everyone -- and we'll tell you that honestly

Talk soon.

## Email 2: The ROI Math

**Send Timing:** Day 1 (24 hours after Email 1)
**Purpose:** Preemptively handle the #1 objection -- "Can I afford this?" / "Is it worth it?"
**Objection Addressed:** Price / ROI concern

**Subject Line:** The math behind 77%
**Preview Text:** 2 members. That's the number.

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Before we chat, I want to share a number that tends to change how gym owners think about software.

**77% of Kilo customers report that the software pays for itself within 3 months.**

Here's the math behind that:

Gym Lead Machine costs $375/month. If your average membership is $180/month and members stick around for 20 months on average, each new member is worth about $3,600 in lifetime revenue.

That means closing just 2 extra members in a year -- not a month, a *year* -- covers your entire annual investment. Everything after that is yours to keep.

Most gyms using GLM report an average of 35 additional qualified leads per month. You don't need to close all of them. You don't even need to close most of them.

You need two.

Not a guarantee -- every gym's results depend on their market, their offer, and their follow-up. But across 1,000+ coaching gyms on the Kilo platform, that's the pattern we see over and over.

We'll walk through your specific numbers on the demo.

{{sender_name}}

P.S. Jay Storey at CrossFit Narellan put it this way after his first week: "7 NSIs and 5 new members in 5 days." That's one gym owner's experience -- but it gives you a sense of what's possible when the system is dialed in.

---

## Email 3: Social Proof Story

**Send Timing:** Day 3 (48 hours after Email 2)
**Purpose:** Build trust with a specific, named case study. Move from data to story.
**Objection Addressed:** "Does this actually work?" / General skepticism

**Subject Line:** How CrossFit Watford added 33 members
**Preview Text:** From 6 new members/month to 14.

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Let me tell you about Charlie Goode.

Charlie runs CrossFit Watford. Before Kilo, his gym was bringing in about 6 new members a month. Not bad -- but not the kind of growth that changes your business.

After switching to Kilo's Gym Lead Machine, his gym averaged 14 new members per month. A net gain of 33 members in the period he tracked.

Same gym. Same coaches. Same location. The difference was the system handling his leads.

Here's what changed:

- His website was rebuilt by Kilo's team -- designed to convert, not just look good
- Every lead got an instant follow-up via text and email (not the next morning -- the next minute)
- Booking an intro session went from "call us" to a one-tap calendar link
- Leads who went cold got automatically re-engaged instead of forgotten

Charlie didn't learn a new platform. He didn't hire a marketing agency. Kilo's team built it, and the system ran it.

That's the part most gym owners don't expect. You're not buying software and figuring it out alone. The Kilo team builds your website, sets up your automation, and handles the ongoing work. You focus on coaching.

Want to see what that looks like for {{gym_name}}? That's exactly what we'll cover on your demo.

[Book your call here]({{booking_link}}) if you haven't already.

{{sender_name}}

P.S. Charlie's experience is one gym's story -- not a promise. But his situation (coaching gym, decent location, no dedicated marketing person) is one we see across a lot of the 1,000+ gyms on the platform. The pattern is consistent even when the specifics vary.

## Email 4: "Will This Work for MY Gym?"

**Send Timing:** Day 5 (48 hours after Email 3)
**Purpose:** Handle the gym-type fit objection. Show that Kilo works across coaching gym types.
**Objection Addressed:** "My gym is different" / "Will this work for my specific type of gym?"

**Subject Line:** "Will this work for MY type of gym?"
**Preview Text:** CrossFit, martial arts, bootcamp, PT -- here's what we've seen.

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Every gym owner I talk to eventually asks the same question:

"Yeah, but will this work for *my* type of gym?"

Fair question. Here's what we've seen across 1,000+ coaching gyms on the Kilo platform:

**CrossFit affiliates** -- This is where Kilo started, and it's still our largest segment. Gyms like CrossFit Narellan (7 NSIs in 5 days) and CrossFit Watford (net gain of 33 members) run on Kilo. The platform is built around the affiliate model: class-based scheduling, community-driven retention, intro-to-membership conversion.

**Martial arts studios** -- Different scheduling needs, different member journey. Kilo handles belt progression, trial class funnels, and family memberships. The lead nurture sequences are customized for how martial arts prospects actually convert (longer decision cycle, more questions about safety and fit).

**Bootcamp & HYROX gyms** -- High-volume class scheduling, challenge-based marketing, and seasonal membership surges. Kilo's automation handles the lead spikes that come with "New Year" and "summer body" campaigns without dropping follow-ups.

**PT studios & small group training** -- Smaller rosters, higher price points, more personalized sales process. The CRM and appointment booking features in GLM are built for this -- fewer leads, but every one matters more.

The common thread: if you run a coaching gym where people show up and a real human coaches them, Kilo was built for how your business works.

If you run a 24/7 access gym with no coaching component, a yoga-only studio, or a franchise with 50+ locations -- there are probably better fits. We'll tell you that on the call.

Still have a demo on the calendar? Good. We'll dig into the specific features that matter for your gym type.

P.S. Lindsey Barber at Fitness Lair (a boutique training gym) said she was "drowning in website traffic I never knew I had" after Kilo rebuilt her site. Different gym type, same result: leads she was losing started showing up.

## Email 5: The Time Reframe

**Send Timing:** Day 7 (48 hours after Email 4)
**Purpose:** Shift the conversation from cost to time. Introduce the "done-for-you" angle as the real differentiator.
**Objection Addressed:** "I don't have time to learn another platform" / "I'm already overwhelmed"

**Subject Line:** The 384 hours nobody talks about
**Preview Text:** What would you do with 7 extra hours every week?

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Let me reframe something.

Most gym owners evaluate software by asking: "What does it cost?"

The better question: "What does it cost me to NOT have it?"

Kilo customers report saving an average of 384 hours per year. That's about 7.4 hours every week -- the equivalent of a full working day -- spent on manual follow-ups, chasing leads, updating spreadsheets, and wrestling with disconnected tools.

Here's what that time looks like in practice:

- Texting leads back one at a time instead of automated instant follow-up
- Manually posting to social media instead of scheduled, done-for-you content
- Rebuilding your website every time you need a change instead of having a team handle it
- Chasing reviews instead of automated review requests after every class

And here's the part that matters most:

**Kilo doesn't hand you a login and say "good luck."**

The Kilo team builds your website for you. They set up your lead nurture sequences. They write and send your monthly newsletters. They redesign your site annually. You don't learn the platform -- you use the results.

That's why "I don't have time to learn another tool" isn't really an objection with Kilo. There's nothing to learn. There's a team doing the work.

If you've been putting off the demo because you're too busy -- that's exactly the problem the demo is about.

P.S. Your website can be live in as little as 9 days from onboarding. Not 9 weeks. Not "when you get around to uploading your content." Nine days, built by Kilo's team.

## Email 6: What Switching Actually Looks Like

**Send Timing:** Day 10 (72 hours after Email 5)
**Purpose:** Remove the last operational objection -- the fear of switching. Make the process feel easy and low-risk.
**Objection Addressed:** "What about switching costs?" / "Migration seems like a nightmare"

**Subject Line:** What switching actually looks like
**Preview Text:** It's not the ordeal you think it is.

---

Hey {{first_name}},

If you're on the fence, I'd bet the thing holding you back isn't whether Kilo works.

It's the switch.

"What about my current members?" "Do I have to re-enter everything?" "What if it breaks something?" "How long until it's actually running?"

These are real concerns. Here's what the process actually looks like:

**Week 1: Onboarding call + data migration.**
Kilo's team migrates your member data, payment info, and class schedules from your current platform. You don't export CSVs and upload them yourself -- the team handles it. Most migrations are completed within 2 business days.

**Week 1-2: Website build.**
If you're using Kilo Websites or GLM, the team builds your site from scratch -- designed for your gym, optimized to convert. Average time: 9 days from kickoff to live. You review it. You approve it. They launch it.

**Week 2: Automation setup.**
Lead follow-up sequences, review requests, appointment booking -- all configured by the Kilo team based on what works for your type of gym. Pre-built templates refined across 1,000+ gyms.

**Ongoing: 3 dedicated support teams.**
Website issues go to the website team. Marketing questions go to the marketing team. Management software questions go to the GMS team. Under 3-hour average email response time.

80% of Kilo customers report the platform is easier to use than what they were using before. The switch isn't a leap of faith -- it's a structured process with a team doing most of the heavy lifting.

If switching is the only thing between you and a system that could change how your gym grows, let's talk about it on the demo. We'll walk through exactly what the transition looks like for your situation.

P.S. Erik Zeyher at Warlock CrossFit called Kilo "an absolute game-changer" and said his gym is "faster, more efficient, and way more profitable" after switching. The switch felt big before he did it. After? He wished he'd done it sooner.

## Email 7: The Close

**Send Timing:** Day 14 (96 hours after Email 6)
**Purpose:** Final re-engagement. Direct, honest, no new information -- just a clear ask with a reason to act now.
**Objection Addressed:** Inertia / procrastination

**Subject Line:** Closing the loop
**Preview Text:** One last note from me.

---

Hey {{first_name}},

This is my last email in this series, so I'll keep it short.

Over the past two weeks, I've shared:

- The ROI math (2 extra members per year covers the cost -- 77% of customers report it pays for itself in 3 months)
- A real gym's results (CrossFit Watford: net gain of 33 members)
- How Kilo works across gym types (CrossFit, martial arts, bootcamp, PT -- 1,000+ coaching gyms and counting)
- The time you'd get back (384 hours per year, on average)
- What switching actually looks like (done-for-you migration, live in 9 days)

If any of that resonated, the next step is a 15-minute demo. Not a hard sell -- a conversation about whether Kilo is the right fit for {{gym_name}}.

If it's not the right time, no hard feelings. You know where to find us.

But if you've been meaning to book and just haven't gotten around to it -- here's the thing:

Every week without a system is another week of leads slipping through the cracks. Not because you're bad at follow-up. Because you're busy coaching, which is exactly what you should be doing.

Kilo exists so you don't have to choose between coaching your members and growing your gym.

P.S. David De Leon at OTL Fitness went from 0 leads to 8 in his first week with Kilo -- no ads, no marketing budget, just a properly built website and automated follow-up. That's not a guarantee for every gym. But it shows what can happen when the system is working for you instead of the other way around.
