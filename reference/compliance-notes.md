## 1. FTC Guidelines for SaaS Performance Claims

### Testimonials & Results Claims
- **FTC Endorsement Guides (16 CFR Part 255):** Testimonials must reflect "typical" results, not outliers. If Kilo claims "77% say GLM pays for itself in 3 months" or "210% membership growth," these must be substantiated with actual customer data
- **"Results not typical" disclaimers are NOT sufficient** — the FTC now requires that claims represent what consumers can generally expect
- **Specific numeric claims** (e.g., "18% more leads," "384 hours saved") must be based on actual survey/performance data. Keep source documentation on file

### Click-to-Cancel Rule (2025/2026)
- **FTC's Negative Option Rule (effective 2025-2026):** SaaS subscriptions must offer cancellation as easy as signup — "click to cancel"
- Cannot require phone calls, chat sessions, or multi-step processes to cancel
- Must clearly disclose: total cost, billing frequency, auto-renewal terms, and cancellation process BEFORE purchase
- **First wave of FTC warning letters** already issued under this rule

### Consumer Review Rule
- **FTC Consumer Review Fairness Act:** Cannot suppress or prohibit customer reviews
- If soliciting reviews (e.g., GLM's Google review request feature), cannot selectively show only positive reviews
- Cannot create or purchase fake reviews

## 2. Meta/Facebook Advertising Policies

### Subscription Service Ads
- Must clearly identify the product as a subscription before the user clicks "Subscribe"
- Landing pages must display: price, billing cycle, cancellation policy, and any free trial limitations
- Misleading "free" claims are prohibited if there's an obligation after trial

### Performance Claims in Ads
- Ads with specific ROI or performance claims (e.g., "860% ROI," "35 more leads per month") may require substantiation if challenged
- Avoid absolute guarantees ("guaranteed results") — use language like "on average" or "reported by X% of customers"
- Competitor comparison claims must be truthful and substantiated — cannot make false claims about competitor capabilities

### Meta Ad Standards
- No discriminatory targeting based on housing, employment, or credit (generally not applicable for gym software)
- Landing pages must match ad content — no bait-and-switch
- Ads must not contain deceptive or misleading content
- Meta Pixel (PixelYourSite) installation detected on Kilo's site — standard for retargeting; ensure pixel data handling complies with privacy policies

## 3. Auto-Renewal / Subscription Disclosure Laws

### Federal Requirements
- **Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act (ROSCA):** Requires clear disclosure of material terms before charging
- **FTC Negative Option Rule:** Pre-purchase disclosure of: what's being sold, total cost, how/when billing occurs, and how to cancel

### State-Level Laws (key states)
- **California (ARL - SB 313):** Must provide clear auto-renewal terms, get affirmative consent, send renewal reminders before charging, provide easy cancellation mechanism
- **New York:** Similar to California; requires clear disclosure and easy cancellation
- **Multiple states** now require email confirmation of subscription enrollment with terms clearly stated
- **2026 Outlook:** More states expected to pass or strengthen auto-renewal laws

### Practical Implications for Kilo Ads
- Any ad promoting a subscription must not obscure the recurring nature of charges
- Free trial ads must clearly state when billing begins and at what rate
- "No hidden fees" claim (used on pricing page) is good — but must be true in practice

## 4. Competitor Comparison Claims

- Comparison advertising is legal but must be **truthful, non-deceptive, and substantiated**
- Kilo's comparison pages (vs Wodify, Zen Planner, PushPress, Mindbody) appear to use factual feature comparisons — this is generally permissible
- Cannot make false claims about competitors' features, pricing, or limitations
- Using competitor brand names in ad copy is permissible (nominative fair use) but using competitor logos or implying endorsement is not
- **Meta policy:** Competitor mention in ads is allowed; however, ads must not be misleading about the competitor

---

## 5. Data Privacy in Advertising

- If Kilo ads promote data handling capabilities (member management, payment processing), claims must be accurate
- **GDPR** (for EU/UK gym customers): Must have proper consent mechanisms for marketing emails/SMS
- **CAN-SPAM Act:** All marketing emails must include unsubscribe mechanism, physical address, and honest subject lines
- **TCPA:** SMS marketing (a key GLM feature) requires explicit opt-in consent; must honor opt-out requests immediately

---

## Summary: Key Rules for Kilo Ad Campaigns

1. **Substantiate all performance claims** — keep survey/data documentation for "18% more leads," "77% ROI in 3 months," etc.
2. **Use "on average" or "reported by X% of customers"** instead of absolute guarantees
3. **Clearly disclose subscription terms** in all ads and landing pages (price, billing frequency, cancellation)
4. **Competitor comparisons must be factual** — feature comparisons are fine, false claims about competitors are not
5. **SMS/email marketing compliance** — ensure GLM's automated nurture sequences have proper opt-in and honor opt-outs
6. **Click-to-cancel** — ensure the subscription cancellation process is as easy as signup
7. **No fake or suppressed reviews** — Google review solicitation via GLM must be non-selective
